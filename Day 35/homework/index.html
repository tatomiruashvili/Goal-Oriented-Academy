        <h2>My current standing as developer</h2>
        <p>I am currently on <b>beginner</b> level, I just <b>recently</b> started learning basics of <u>python</u> and <u>html</u>
        I am learning coding at <b><u>Goal-Oriented-Academy</u></b> which has been success so far, had to mention it.
        As can see that i have very small knowledge of coding which is proved by this miserable webpage you're reading 
        but i am in process of development and looking forward to it</p>
